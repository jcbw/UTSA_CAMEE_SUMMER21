This notebook was created for the CAMEE professional development workshop on extreme environements, dated June 22, 2021. It references the Polartrec Sea ice and deep sea currents information: https://www.polartrec.com/resources/lesson/sea-ice-and-deep-sea-currents. The documentation following the full lession plan is found here: https://www.polartrec.com/files/resources/lesson/43376/docs/full_lesson_sea_ice_and_deep_sea_currents.pdf and lesson materials located here: https://www.polartrec.com/files/resources/lesson/43376/docs/lesson_materials.pdf. This exercise strives to demonstrate the use of ice core data to examine and quantify changes in salinity with depth in Polar sea systems.
